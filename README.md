### Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

Steven Lindburger’s 1982 film, *Tron*, is set inside a video game, and is known as the earliest major film to use CG animation. 

Towards the end of the official trailer for *Tron*, the camera zooms out from a black space filled with pixelated layers of computer-generated shapes, revealing increasing numbers of shape layers suspended in the space. 

Incorporating the dynamic, colourful and energetic feel of these stills in the major coding project would provide interest, depth and animation to Mondrian’s *Broadway Boogie Woogie*. Both the painting and stills are reminiscent of an aerial view of a bustling city, providing a conceptual framework for the major project. 

### Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

The coding technique for “lines” from the p5.mapper library could be used to enhance *Broadway Boogie Woogie* in the style of the *Tron* stills. 

The example implementation of this code on a black backdrop emphasises the ‘pop’ of the colour and the contrast between light and dark. Using this coding technique could add dynamism, animation and luminance to the colours of the lines and rectangles in *Broadway Boogie Woogie*.
